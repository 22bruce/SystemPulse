[Service]
Type=simple
# IMPORTANT: Adjust the User, Group, ExecStart, and WorkingDirectory paths
# according to your deployment location and desired user.
#
# Example: If you place the ip_reporter directory in /opt/ip_reporter
# and have a dedicated user 'ipreporter' to run the service:
# User=ipreporter
# Group=ipreporter
# ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /opt/ip_reporter/client/client_app.py
# WorkingDirectory=/opt/ip_reporter/client/
#
# For a simpler setup, running as root (ensure client_app.py is executable):
# ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /opt/ip_reporter/client/client_app.py
# WorkingDirectory=/opt/ip_reporter/client/
#
# Or if you install dependencies in a virtual environment:
# ExecStart=/opt/ip_reporter/venv/bin/python3 /opt/ip_reporter/client/client_app.py

# Using placeholder paths, assuming python3 is in /usr/bin/python3
# and the application is in /opt/ip_reporter
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /opt/ip_reporter/client/client_app.py
WorkingDirectory=/opt/ip_reporter/client/
